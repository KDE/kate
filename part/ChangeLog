2001-11-30 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>
  * I hopefully fixed the CSS highlighting finally. It used
     deprecated syntax and there was a bug in the highlighting code,
     for handling weakDeliminiators. Who renamed them, once they where
     called weakDelimiters, which I think is the correct pronounciation.

2001-11-29 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>

2001-10-27 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org
  * Highlighting isn't updated completely yet (should be fixed now), but uses:
  * I have to do some nasty workaround because the overloaded ==
    operator in QMemArray crashes, if one or both of the arrays has
    a size of 0 (I think this is a bug in QT, but it could be that
    this is intended behaviour. Who knows ?)

2001-10-26 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>
  * The stacked highlighting shoul almost work now.
    Using old description files it will use quite a lot memory, but
    they should work.
    Problems:
  * It's leaking like a sieve on destruction, because the
    memarrays aren't deleted correctly yet (They need to be pointers and not
    references, otherwise there are out of memory errors in qgarray)
  * Highlighting isn't updated completely yet
  * I have to do some nasty workaround because the overloaded ==
    operator in QMemArray crashes, if one or both of the arrays has
    a size of 0 (I think this is a bug in QT, but it could be that
    this is intended behaviour. Who knows ?)

2001-10-20 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>

  * HTML button - select text, hit <Ctrl+Dash>, and enter the fields
    for an SGML tag. Don't enter the < > or closing tag. We put these
    around the selected text, and [try to] re-select that text so you can add
    another nested tag right away. We are now the first HTML editor
    that's actually better than Notepad! Hours of fun.

  * Filter - select text, hit <Ctrl+Backslash>, and enter an OS command.
    we pipe the selected text thru that command, such as "sort", and then
    replace the selection with the result. Impress your friends.
