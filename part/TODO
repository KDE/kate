TODO:

**** Bugs ****
* access of deleted cursors by the dynamic hl stuff
* cursor position after undo

* arbitrary highlighting
  * failure to redraw when the cursor is off the screen and the highlighting changes

* highlighting issues
  * external context references don't pick up default attribute (bug 145052)

* color issues
  * use color roles when they become available to initialize attributes - DONE
    -> check if this does indeed fix bug 143606
  * port to KStatefulBrush (how do we use this? need to repaint on losing focus or will Qt do it?)

* HL configuration issues
  * current highlighter not selected (regression)
  * controls seem to need to be clicked twice?

* since KDE4 we have a Mode for every Highlighting file. Opening a file leads to a
  call of QString KateModeManager::wildcardsFind (const QString &fileName), which is
  very slow. Opening 50 files in the Kate Application is *very* slow. Needs to be
  vastly improved ...somehow...

* try not to repaint the whole view on every keystroke. according to fredrikh,
  this makes kate almost unusable with EXA.

**** Refactoring/Cleanups ****
* code cleanups wherever needed ;)

* KateViewInternal to be completely hidden from view for almost everything but
  the view itself.

  -> in progress, almost done for most parts, viewinternal only visible to friends of KateView

* Separate more functionality from KateDocument (selections moving to KateView,
  a plugin manager class, a config class, etc)

  -> in progress:
      * config classes already in place
      * selection moved to KateView

* Memory usage and leak auditing
  * KateHlContext::items needs to be implicitly shared + autodelete

**** new features ****

* Fix EOL whitespace cleaning finally by removing whitespace at load-time and
  keeping the document consistent all the time

  -> DONE ;) whitespaces are no cleaned at load time, the magic clean on save stuff is gone
    -> is bug 115175 fixed?
  Ah, but there are bugs:
  * indenting a block of text will create whitespace on lines that were empty to start with
    -> could be fixed by adapting KateNormalIndent::indent()
       -> already fixed. ::indent does not add spaces if there are none.

* BiDi finally, using Scribe
  * just needs porting of deprecated calls, and testing

* Finally implement arbitrary highlighting and arbitrary input filtering
  * Smart Cursors and Ranges todo list:
    * change edit notification to come as KTextEditor::EditInfo or similar
      * types: Insert, Remove, Change, Batch -> more EditInfos
      * Implement batching
        * multiple edits for one logical edit
        * multiple logical edits for one undo step
    * fix passive changes to cursors/ranges
      * extra regression testing needed to check that notifications work across SmartGroup boundaries
      * implement feedback requirement tree
    * consider a custom pointer type for Smart* objects
      * consider removing it now that the multiple watchers plan is probably better
    * dynamic highlighting
      * catch highlighting being created where the mouse or caret already occupies
        * probably already implemented, guess it just needs testing
    * add a QVariant as data store for 3rd party apps ?
    * D-pointer consideration
      * shouldn't get dptr imho
    * move back any excessively exposed parts of the smart ranges and cursors
    * testcases
    * performances testing suite
      * need to implement edit merging to reduce changes to cursors with large single edits
    * cachegrinding
    * make a translation snapshot feature where you can translate any cursor from a certain point in time - would be very cool :)
    * code cleanup
      * add advance{Pos|Line|Column} functions and replace the set*(*+x) calls

* Switch internal highlighting to use arbitrary highlighting api and thus be
  exposed (read-only)
  * only if the above cursors and ranges can be made to perform well enough

* Buffer reentrancy for multithreaded access
  * needed for potential:
    * separate threads for processing of bracket marks,
    * third party processing

* More robust history including cursor position history

* More featureful code completion including syntax highlighted entries
  * done:
    * model based completion
    * non-focused completion box (view passes on any interactions required)
    * native highlighting of completion entries
    * column resizing on scroll
    * highlighting
    * add a column to CodeCompletionModel to enable displaying an icon just before a completion's name
    * column merging
    * filtering of items based on metadata
    * multiple model merging
    * extend metadata to include inheritance depth of an item
    * implement configurability
      * show/hide/reorder/merge columns
      * sorting list
      * filtering list
  * in progress:
    * implement sorting of items based on metadata, and sorted group headers
      * needs to react to model changes
    * automatic invocation of code completion
    * multiple code completion providers
    * api improvement: generic way to detect when a completion could be offered, and possibly replaceable with a plugin, so that multiple model completion can be offered
    * connect signals from source model to katecompletionmodel and vice-versa
  * todo
    * provide a way to have a small/tiny box? e.g. the word-completion plugin does not need much...
    * implement click-execution of completion entries based on KDE click policy
    * implement configurability
      * positioning retaining horizontal sync with text when it would mean the completion box going outside the screen or not (alternative: reorganise columns, hide column(s))
      * highlighting mode (native / custom / user / combination)
      * consider embedding 3rd party cc config with the above
    * make sure enough info is exported that the current completion's documentation can be retreived in a documentation browser;
      * place basic documentation in an extended popup... positioning / design still to be worked out
    * configurability of keyboard commands for cc
    * refine keyboard control
  * performance testing and optimisation
    * test user-defined highlighting
    * test for thread safety

* Custom widgets in between lines interface (eg. so kcachegrind could use
  katepart to display its cpu usage information etc)
  * Add an extraHeight() field to KateLineLayout
  * Change linesDisplayed() over to use these extra heights
  * Remove assumptions about the fixed height of lines (the difficult part? maybe not so hard seeing it supports dynamic wrapping)
  * Expose via an interface

* KateFoldingTree* to use smart*

* Fix folding for HL's where region end is defined by a new region starting (bug 112888)

* Splitting a view over multiple columns

* Modular input subsystem, to support emulation of other editors in a clean way
  -> see also scripting and idea with extending the command line

* Improved input modes especially in block selection

* Multiple selection support

* Better support for information overlay (eg. documentation of a function -
  switch between short / detailed descriptions)

* Whatever else is needed for multiuser editing (and perhaps put most of it
  inside the part, so eg. kate, kdevelop, quanta etc. could all use it)

* Scripting using kjs (in progress)
  * finish API
    * KateJSDocument: search, searchBackward, etc
    * add API so that scripts can save&load data (remember: we don't have persistent loaded scripts right now)
    * add mode to command line, where every keystroke executes a script (vim like command mode)
      * idea: F7 -> command mode, if you hit ':' you can use the cmd line just like now and type eg. set-highlight c++;
  * evaluate again QtScript. The really good Qt-integration and documentation
    is a big win.

* Good interface for JavaScript indentation scripts
  It is a good idea to look how other editors deal with indentation, I think vim & emacs are good
  references...
  The INDENTATION file in this directory describes the general concepts.

* Cursor position restriction extension
  * export enough api to allow 3rd party apps to provide a cursor that
    * handles advancing/retreating
    * allows to query if a position is a valid cursor position, and to find the closest valid position
  * create a test version which does some basic restriction

* Input restriction extension
  * needed? probably not

* improved block selection with tabs
  * block selection on tabs selects too much of the line that contains the tab, because the tab 
    counts as one character but is rendered as multiple visible spaces. There are several possible 
    solutions:
    * expand the whole blockselection to include the whole width of the tab 
    * cut the tab into multiple spaces
    * implement both and make it configurable :)
